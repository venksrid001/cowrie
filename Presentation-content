How we'll implement - Shruti
 - Continue development on python
 - To implement our 2 commands, weâ€™ll be breaking them down into smaller functions
 - Pair programming
 - Main focus is nano
 - Nano functions are: open, save, exit + cut, paste, replace, find
 - Locate functions: string search and output function that will print the file name and the absolute path to the file
 - Done in fortnightly sprints, to make small developments and consistent progress 
 - Client will have the opportunity to voice feedback and we can make changes early on
