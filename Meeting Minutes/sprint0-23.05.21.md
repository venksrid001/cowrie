Attendees: Sridhar, Deepika, Shruti, Selby, Thomas

We have decided for our proof of concept to ensure when a user runs 'nano' -> it will then summon a text editing environment for the user to edit a file.

Also planning to prepare slides for our group presentation - where we will be presenting our initial proof of concept.

We haven't started on using user stories/story mapping as it would be sufficient if most of the group can attend in person to ensure we do it as a group.

Two Epics have been created on the GitLab: Text Editor, and one for Locate.

Issue has been created to implement the proof of concept by 1st of June.
