**Update:**
- Lucy: Sections done, can still go over the editing Thursday
- Deepika: section completed
- Thomas: Almost done in his section
- Selby: Section completed
- Sridar: Complete section having to add more due to move to Locate over whoami
- Shruti: Section completed

---
**Things to do:**
- Update the whoami parts of the architecture document to the locate command
- Email Masood with the change
- Email Masood the new document once complete
- Lucy to edit Thurdsday and Selby to cover if needed
- All sections to be compelted and merged with the main document

---
**Comments/Concerns:**
Discussion around the change of the document. The addition of the locate command will not be a big change. We will be able to swap the whoami section out for locate. 

The whoami command has been implemented dynamically already within Cowrie.

Shridar and Selby to help Thomas to confirm the program logic is correct within Cowrie.



Deadline confirmed for Friday 20th midnight.
