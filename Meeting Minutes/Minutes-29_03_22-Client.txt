- Dynamic output with commands specifically whoami, also providing some editor for files within the honeypot.  

- Don't want a full fledged editor that relies on other libraries, just need to provide an editor that runs on a basic script and fulfil basic editing functionalities (support for commands such as nano)

- Creating a new file, the umask should properly represent the creators rights for the file. 

- Identify a set of commands to simulate, these commands will be discussed with the client. These commands will provide dynamic output, which will help fool the attacker. 

- Demonstration of the output of the commands, send it to the client and client will test it. 

- Documentation for code added. Get familiar with cowrie for now. 

- Client will send the cowrie documentation.
